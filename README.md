# YouTube LLM Project (Incomplete)

This project is a machine learning model that aims to classify YouTube videos based on their statistics. The model is built using PyTorch and the data is preprocessed using pandas and NLTK.

## Project Structure

The project consists of several Python scripts:

- `main.py`: This is the main script that ties everything together. It loads and preprocesses the data, initializes the model, and trains it.
- `data_preprocessing.py`: This script contains the `load_and_preprocess_data` function which loads the data from a CSV file, preprocesses it (drops irrelevant columns, handles missing values, tokenizes the text), and returns a DataFrame.
- `text_classification_model.py`: This script defines the `TextClassifier` class, which is a PyTorch model for text classification.
- `train_model.py`: This script contains the `train_and_evaluate` function which trains the model on the data and evaluates its performance.
- `utils.py`: This script contains utility functions for tokenizing text and preparing text data.

## To-Do List

Here are some tasks that still need to be completed:

1. Implement error handling: The code currently does not handle any errors that might occur during execution. Add try-except blocks to handle potential errors and make the code more robust.
2. Improve code documentation: Add comments and docstrings to the code to explain what each part of the code is doing.
3. Test the model: Once the model is trained, test it on some unseen data to evaluate its performance.
4. Refine the model: Depending on the performance of the model on the test data, you might need to go back and refine the model. This could involve tuning hyperparameters, changing the model architecture, or using a different approach altogether.
5. Implement a user interface: If you want to make the model more user-friendly, consider implementing a user interface that allows users to input their own data and get predictions from the model.

## Getting Started

To run this project, you will need Python 3.6 or later and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
- [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/)
- [gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html).

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas torch nltk gensim
```

To run the `main.py` script, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

```bash
python main.py "/path/to/your/data/file.csv"
```

Replace `"/path/to/your/data/file.csv"` with the path to your data file.
